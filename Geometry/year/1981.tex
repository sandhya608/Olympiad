\item P is a point inside a given triangle ABC.D, E, F are the feet of the perpendiculars from P to the lines BC, CA, AB respectively. Find all P for which
\begin{align*}
\frac{BC}{PD} + \frac{CA}{PE} + \frac{AB}{PF}
\end{align*}
is least.

\item Three congruent circles have a common point O and lie inside a given triangle. Each circle touches a pair of sides of the triangle. Prove that the in-center and the circum center of the triangle and the point O are collinear.
