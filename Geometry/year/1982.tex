\item The diagonals AC and CE of the regular hexagon ABCDEF are divided by the inner points M and N, respectively, so that
\begin{align*}
\frac{AM}{AC} = \frac{CN}{CE} = r
\end{align*}
Determine r if B, M, and N are collinear.

\item A non-isosceles triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ is given with sides $a_1, a_2, a_3$ ($a_i$ is the side opposite $A_i$). For all i = 1, 2, 3, $M_i$ is the midpoint of side $a_i,$ and $T_i.$ is the point where the in-circle touches side $a_i.$ Denote by $S_i$ the reflection of $T_i$ in the interior bisector of angle $A_i.$ Prove that the lines $M_1, S_1, M_2S_2,$ and $M_3S_3$ are concurrent.
