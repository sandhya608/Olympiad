\item Consider two coplanar circles of radii R and r $(R > r)$ with the same center. Let P be a fixed point on the smaller circle and B a variable point on the larger circle. The line BP meets the larger circle again at C. The perpendicular l to BP at P meets the smaller circle again at A. (If l is tangent to the circle at P
then A = P.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the set of values of $BC^2 + CA^2 + AB^2$.
\item Find the locus of the midpoint of BC.
\end{enumerate}

\item ABC is a triangle right-angled at A, and D is the foot of the altitude from A. The straight line joining the incenters of the triangles ABD, ACD intersects the sides AB, AC at the points K, L respectively. S and T denote the areas of the triangles ABC and AKL respectively. Show that S$ \geq 2T$.
