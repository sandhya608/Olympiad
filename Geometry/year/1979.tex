\item Two circles in a plane intersect. Let A be one of the points of intersection. Starting simultaneously from A two points move with constant speeds, each point travelling along its own circle in the same sense. The two points return to A simultaneously after one revolution. Prove that there is a fixed point P in the plane such that, at any time, the distances from P to the moving points are equal.

\item Given a plane $\pi$, a point P in this plane and a point Q not in $\pi$, find all points R in $\pi$ such that the ratio $\frac{(QP + PA)}{QR}$ is a maximum.
