\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral such that the line CD is a tangent to the circle on AB as diameter. Prove that the line AB is a tangent to the circle on CD as diameter if and only if the lines BC and AD are parallel.

\item In the plane two different points O and A are given. For each point X of the plane, other than O, denote by a(X) the measure of the angle between OA and OX in radians, counter clockwise from OA$(0 \leq a(X) < 2\pi).$ Let C(X) be the circle with center O and radius of length OX + a(X)/(OX). Each point of the plane is colored by one of a finite number of colors. Prove that there exists a point Y for which $a(Y) > 0$ such that its color appears on the circumference of the circle C(Y ).
