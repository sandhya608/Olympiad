\item A circle has center on the side AB of the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD.The other three sides are tangent to the circle. Prove that $AD + BC = AB$.

\item A circle with center O passes through the vertices A and C of triangle ABC and intersects the segments AB and BC again at distinct points K and N, respectively. The circumscribed circles of the triangles ABC and EBN intersect at exactly two distinct points B and M. Prove that angle OMB is a right angle.
