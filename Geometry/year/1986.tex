\item A triangle $A_1 A_2 A_3$ and a point $P_0$ are given in the plane. We define $A_s = A_{s-3}$ for all s $\geq$ 4. We construct a set of points $P_1, P_2, P_3,$......, such that $P_{k+1}$ is the image of $P_k$ under a rotation with center $A_{k+1}$ through angle $120^{o}$ clockwise (for k = 0,1,2,.....). Prove that if $P_{1986}= P_0,$ then the triangle $A_1 A_2 A_3$ is equilateral.

\item Let A, B be adjacent vertices of a regular n-gon (n $\geq$ 5) in the plane having center at O. A triangle XYZ, which is congruent to and initially coincides with OAB, moves in the plane in such a way that Y and Z each trace out the whole boundary of the polygon, X remaining inside the polygon. Find the locus of X.
