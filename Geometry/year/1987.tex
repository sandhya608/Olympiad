\item In an acute-angled triangle ABC the interior bisector of the angle A intersects BC at L and intersects the circum circle of ABC again at N. From point L perpendiculars are drawn to AB and AC, the feet of these perpendiculars being K and M respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral AKNM and the triangle ABC have equal areas.
