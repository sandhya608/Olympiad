\item P is a given point inside a given sphere. Three mutually perpendicular rays from P intersect the sphere at points U, V, and W ; Q denotes the vertex diagonally opposite to P in the parallelepiped determined by PU, PV, and PW. Find the locus of Q for all such triads of rays from P.

\item In triangle ABC, AB = AC. A circle is tangent internally to the circum circle of triangle ABC and also to sides AB, AC at P, Q, respectively. Prove that the midpoint of segment PQ is the center of the in-circle of triangle ABC.
