\item Chords AB and CD of a circle intersect at a point E inside the circle. Let M be an interior point of the segment EB. The tangent line at E to the circle through D, E, and M intersects the lines BC and AC at F and G, respectively. If $\frac{AM}{AB}$ = t, find $\frac{EG}{EF}$ interms of t.

\item Prove that there exists a convex 1990-gon with the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All angles are equal.
\item The lengths of the 1990 sides are the numbers $1^2, 2^2, 3^2,........, 1990^2$ in some order.
\end{enumerate}
