\item In an acute-angled triangle ABC the internal bisector of angle A meets the circum circle of the triangle again at $A_1$. Points $B_1$ and $C_1$ are defined similarly. Let $A_0$ be the point of intersection of the line A$A_1$ with the external bisectors of angles B and C. Points $B_0$ and $C_0$ are defined similarly. Prove that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The area of the triangle $A_0B_0C_0$ is twice the area of the hexagon $AC_1BA_1CB_1$.
\item The area of the triangle $A_0B_0C_0$ is at least four times the area of the triangle ABC.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral such that the sides AB, AD, BC satisfy AB = AD + BC. There exists a point P inside the quadrilateral at a distance h from the line CD such that AP = h + AD and BP = h + BC. Show that:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{AD}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{BC}}
\end{align*}
