\item An international society has its members from six different countries. The list of members contains 1978 names, numbered 1, 2,....., 1978. Prove that there is at least one member whose number is the sum of the numbers of two members from his own country, or twice as large as the number of one member from his own country.

\item The set of all positive integers is the union of two disjoint subsets
\begin{align*}
(f(1), f(2),.., f(n),..), (g(1), g(2),.., g(n),..),
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
f(1) < f(2) < ..... < f(n) < .......,\\
g(1) < g(2) < ......< g(n) < .......,
\end{align*}
and
g(n) = f(f(n)) + 1 for all n $\geq$ 1.
Determine f(240).
