\item Let n be an integer greater than or equal to 3. Prove that there is a set of n points in the plane such that the distance between any two points is irrational and each set of three points determines a non-degenerate triangle with rational area.

\item Prove that there is no function f from the set of non-negative integers into itself such that\\ 
f(f(n)) = n + 1987 for every n.

\item Let $p_{n}(k)$ be the number of permutations of the set (1,........n), $n \geq 1$, which have exactly k fixed points. Prove that
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=0}^{n} k.p_n(k) = n!.
\end{align*}
