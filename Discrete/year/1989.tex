\item A permutation $(x_1, x_2,......, x_m)$ of the set (1, 2,........., 2n), where n is a positive integer, is said to have property P if $\begin{vmatrix} x_i - x_{i+1} \end{vmatrix}$ = n for at least one i in (1,2,......, 2n - 1). Show that, for each n, there are more permutations with property P than without.

\item Prove that the set (1, 2,........, 1989) can be expressed as the disjoint union of subsets $A_i$ (i = 1, 2,......., 117) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each $A_i$ contains 17 elements;
\item The sum of all the elements in each $A_i$ is the same.
\end{enumerate}
