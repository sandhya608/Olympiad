\item Let A and E be opposite vertices of a regular octagon. A frog starts jumping at vertex A. From any vertex of the octagon except E, it may jump to either of the two adjacent vertices. When it reaches vertex E, the frog stops and stays there.. Let $a_n$ be the number of distinct paths of exactly n jumps ending at E. Prove that $a_{2n - 1} = 0,$
\begin{align*}
 a_{2n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^{n-1} - y^{n-1}), n = 1, 2, 3,......,
\end{align*}
where x = 2 + $\sqrt{2}$ and y = 2 - $\sqrt{2}$.\\
Note. A path of n jumps is a sequence of vertices $(P_0, ..., P_n)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P_0$ = A, $P_n$ = E;
\item for every i, $0 \leq i \leq n - 1, P_i$ is distinct from E;
\item for every i, $0 \leq i \leq n - 1, P_i$ and $ P_{i+1}$ are adjacent.
\end{enumerate}
