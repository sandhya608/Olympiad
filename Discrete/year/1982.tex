\item The function f(n) is defined for all positive integers n and takes on non-negative integer values. Also, for all m, n\\
f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 or 1\\
f(2) = 0, $f(3) > 0,$ and f(9999) = 3333.\\
Determine f(1982).

\item Let S be a square with sides of length 100, and let L be a path within S which does not meet itself and which is composed of line segments $A_0A_1, A_1A_2,......, A_{n - 1}A_n$ with $A_0 \neq A_n.$ Suppose that for every point P of the boundary of S there is a point of L at a distance from P not greater than $\frac{1}{2}.$ Prove that there are two points X and Y in L such that the distance between X and Y is not greater than 1, and the length of that part of L which lies between X and Y is not smaller than 198.
