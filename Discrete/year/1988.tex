\item Show that set of real numbers x which satisfy the inequality
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{70} \frac{k}{x-k} \geq \frac{5}{4}
\end{align*}
is a union of disjoint intervals, the sum of whose lengths is 1988.

\item A function f is defined on the positive integers by
\begin{align*}
f(1) = 1, f(3) = 3,\\
f(2n) = f(n),\\
f(4n + 1) = 2f(2n + 1) - f(n),\\
f(4n + 3) = 3f(2n + 1) - 2f(n)
\end{align*}
for all positive integers n.
Determine the number of positive integers n, less than or equal to 1988, for which f(n) = n.
