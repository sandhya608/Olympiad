\item Given an initial integer $n_0 > 1$, two players, A and B, choose integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$,....... alternately according to the following rules: Knowing $n_{2k}$, A chooses any integer $n_{2k+1}$ such that\\
 $n_{2k} \geq n_{2k+1} \geq n^2_{2k}$.Knowing $n_{2k+1}$, B chooses any integer $n_{2k+2}$ such that $\frac{n_{2k+1}}{n_{2k+2}}$ is a prime raised to a positive integer power.\\
 Player A wins the game by choosing the number 1990; player B wins by choosing
the number 1. For which $n_0$ does:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A have a winning strategy?
\item B have a winning strategy?
\item Neither player have a winning strategy?
\end{enumerate}

\item  Determine all integers $n > 1$ such that $\frac{2^{n} + 1}{n^{2}}$ is an integer.
