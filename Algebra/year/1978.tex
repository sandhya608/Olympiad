\item m and n are natural numbers with $1 \leq m \leq n.$ In their decimal representations, the last three digits of $1978^{m}$ are equal, respectively, to the last three digits of $1978^{n}.$ Find m and n such that m + n has its least value.

\item Let $a_{k}$(k = 1, 2, 3,....., n,.....) be a sequence of distinct positive integers. Prove that for all natural numbers n,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}(\frac{a_k}{k^2}) \geq \sum_{k=1}^{n}(\frac{1}{k})
\end{align*}
