\item Let n and k be positive integers and let S be a set of n points in the plane such
that
\begin{enumerate}
\item No three points of S are collinear, and
\item For any point P of S there are at least k points of S equidistant from P .
\end{enumerate}
Prove that $k < \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{2n}$

\item Prove that for each positive integer n there exist n consecutive positive integers
none of which is an integral power of a prime number.
