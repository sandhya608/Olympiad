\item Consider the infinite sequences $x_n$ of positive real numbers with the following properties: 
$x_0$ = 1, and for all $i \geq 0, x_{i+1} \leq x_i.$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that for every such sequence, there is an $n \geq 1$ such that
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + \frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + .......\frac{x_{n - 1}^2}{x_n} \geq 3.999.
\end{align*}
\item Find such a sequence for which
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + \frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + .......\frac{x_{n - 1}^2}{x_n} < 4
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate} 

\item Prove that if n is a positive integer such that the equation
\begin{align}
x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3 = n
\end{align}
has a solution in integers (x, y), then it has at least three such solutions.Show that the equation has no solution in integers when n=2891.
