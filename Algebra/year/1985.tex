\item Let n and k be given relatively prime natural numbers, $k < n$. Each number in the set M = (1,2,.., $n-1$) is colored either blue or white. It is given that
\begin{enumerate}
\item  for each i $ \in $ M, both i and n - i have the same color;
\item for each i $ \in $ M, i $ \neq $ k, both i and $\begin{vmatrix} i - k \end{vmatrix}$ have the same color. Prove that all numbers in M must have the same color.
\end{enumerate}

\item For any polynomial $P(x) = a_{0} + a_{1} +..... + a_{k}x^{k}$ with integer coefficients, the number of coefficients which are odd is denoted by w(P). For i = 0, 1,....., let $Q_{i}(x) = (1 + x)^{i}.$ Prove that if $i_{1}i_{2},.....,i_{n}$ are integers such that $0 \leq i_{1} < i_{2} < ..... < i_{n},$ then $w(Q_{i1} + Q_{i2}, +  Q_{in}) \geq w(Q_{i1})$.

\item For every real number $x_1,$ construct the sequence $x_1, x_2,$.... by setting
\begin{align*}
x_{n+1} = x_n(x_n + \frac{1}{n})
\end{align*} 
for each $n \geq 1.$
Prove that there exists exactly one value of $x_1$ for which $0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1$ for every n.
