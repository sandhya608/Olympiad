\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item For which values of $n > 2$ is there a set of n consecutive positive integers such that the largest number in the set is a divisor of the least common multiple of the remaining n - 1 numbers?
\item For which values of $n > 2$ is there exactly one set having the stated property?
\end{enumerate}

\item Determine the maximum value of $m^3 + n^3,$ where m and n are integers
satisfying m, n $\in$ (1, 2,...,1981) and 
\begin{align*}
(n^{2} - mn - m^{2})^2 = 1.
\end{align*}
