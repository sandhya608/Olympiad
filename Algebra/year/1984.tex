\item Prove that $0 \leq yz + zx + xy - 2xyz \leq \frac{7}{27},$ where x, y and z are non-negative real numbers for which x + y + z = 1.

\item Find one pair of positive integers a and b such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ab(a + b) is not divisible by 7;
\item $(a + b)^{7} - a^{7} - b^{7}$ is divisible by $7^{7}$.
\end{enumerate}
Justify your answer.

\item Let a, b, c and d be odd integers such that $0 < a < b < c < d$ and ad = bc. 
Prove that if a + d = $2^{k}$ and b + c = $2^{m}$ for some integers k and m, then a = 1.
