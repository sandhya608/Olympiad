\item Let n be a positive integer and let $A_1, A_2,....,A_{2n+1}$ be subsets of a set B. Suppose that
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each $A_i$ has exactly 2n elements,
\item  Each $A_i \cap A_j (1 \leq i < j \leq 2n + 1)$ contains exactly one element, and
\item Every element of B belongs to at least two of the $A_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Foe which values of n can one assign to every element of B one of the numbers 0 and 1 in such a way that $A_i$  has zero assign to exactly n of its elements.

\item Let a and b be positive integers such that ab + 1 divides $a^2 + b^2$. Show that
\begin{align*}
\frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{ab + 1}
\end{align*}
is the square of an integer.
