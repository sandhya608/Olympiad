\item Let a, b and c be positive integers, no two of which have a common divisor greater than 1. Show that 2abc - ab - bc - ca is the largest integer which cannot be expressed in the form xbc + yca + zab, where x, y and z are non-negative integers.

\item Let a, b and c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Prove that
\begin{align*}
a^{2}b(a - b) + b^{2}c(b - c) + c^{2}a(c - a) \geq 0.
\end{align*}
Determine when equality occurs.
